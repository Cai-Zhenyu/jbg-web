<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p class="question">  I want to work with you, and I'm currently a student at UMD</p>

<p class="answer">First, take computational linguistics, machine learning, or
digging into data.  Once you've done
that, <a href="http://jbg.youcanbook.me">schedule
a meeting</a>, and we'll figure out a project to work on together.  After we
finish the project, we can discuss longer-term arrangments.</p>

<p class="question">I want to work with you, and I'm not currently a student at UMD</p>

<p class="answer">Then you should apply to be a student at the
University of Maryland.  The best way would be to apply to
the <a href="http://ischool.umd.edu/content/programs">College of
Information Studies</a> and mention me specifically in your
application.  I do also work with computer science students; if that
is more your specialty, you
should <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/Grad/catalog.shtml">apply to
computer science</a> and mention
the <a href="https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page">CLIP
lab</a> (and me) in your application.  After you submit an
application, please drop me an e-mail with your CV letting me know you
applied.  I may not reply, but it's still very useful!</p>

<p class="question">Do you have any postdocs available?</p>

<p class="answer">I'm fairly junior, so I'm trying to fund students right now.
I'm fairly good about keeping my webpage updated, so if I am publicly looking
for a postdoc it will be under the <b>news</b> section on my homepage.</p>

<p class="question">What are your expectations / preferences in terms of what a student should know?</p>

<p class="answer">
I personally like C++ and Python, but the culture here leans to Java,
which I've been using more and more (and likely will continue to).  I
prefer writing tests to debugging, but debugging is a necessary evil.
I do like reinventing the wheel somewhat to keep things self-contained
and consistent, but I contribute the result to things
like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nltk">NLTK</a> so that other
people don't have to do the same.  I also like using style checkers
and the like to keep myself organized.  (Though I say this, you can
get a more honest picture of my coding style by looking at what I've
actually written.)</p>

<p class="answer">Anyhow, you probably can already code in some
language pretty well, and conforming to my coding style will increase
the probability that I'll be more hands-on in helping you code and
debug, but if you want to program in LISP or Prolog, that's perfectly
fine too, as long as it works for you.</p>

<p class="answer">Being comfortable with probability is probably the
more important requirement.  You'll likely have to deal with messy
probability distributions, take expectations, derive conditional
distributions given a joint distribution, implement dynamic programing
to sample from PCFG grammars, do Taylor approximations, do some
optimizations, etc.  This shouldn't be taken as a laundry list of
things you should know (it's great if you do) but just as a heads up
of the kinds of things you might run into; part of a graduate
education (life, for that matter) is learning new stuff.  There will
be many opportunities to learn: from classes (at Maryland: NLP 1 &amp;
2, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing), your peers, and reading
group.</p>

<p class="answer">I think attending (and contributing to) a reading
group or two is critical for learning about a field and being a good
scholar; it's fun and not a chore at all, but I want to be up front in
saying that any student of mine should be an active participant in a
reading group or two.</p>

<p class="question">How do you interact with students?</p>

<p class="answer">I like to have a group meeting every other week with students
I'm working with (broadly construed), and one-on-one meetings as needed with
students.  I use Google calendar to <a href="http://jbg.youcanbook.me">set up my
appointments</a>, so students can grab a meeting whenever they need to.  I
expect students working with me full time to meet with me on average once a week
(sometimes much more, such as before a paper deadline, and sometimes less).  I
use this online system so that my meetings are contiguous and that students
always know when I'm available (and I can change things without e-mail).
Students should sign up for a meeting at least 24 hours in advance.  It's okay
to schedule meetings outside of that time, but that should be the exception (I
try to maximize the amount of contiguous time I have to research, write, and
think).</p>

<p class="answer">In addition, everyone in my group (me included) sends a weekly e-mail to everybody saying:
<ul>
  <li class="answer"> What they worked on that week </li>
  <li class="answer"> What they plan to work on next week </li>
  <li class="answer"> Anything that's holding them up or blocking their progress </li>
</ul></p>
<p class="answer">Anyone who is working for me full time or who is my direct
advisee <b>must</b> send me such an e-mail (with the subject [Weekly Snippet
YYYY MM DD]) sometime on Monday Eastern time.  I find that this is very helpful
because I sometimes ask myself (or have funding agencies ask me) what I (and my
students) did in a particular time period.  These e-mails really help me figure
that out without bugging other people.  It also helps me stay productive by
setting realistic goals; I use this weekly todo list to populate my daily todo
list.</p>

<p class="answer">Outside of that, I prefer face-to-face communication (when I'm not sitting
down at my computer being productive) or e-mail as a communication mechanism.
Instant messages are also sometimes okay for quick questions, but never send an
e-mail and then ask via IM "Did you see my e-mail?"</p>

<p class="question">How should you put LaTeX documents in a version
control system?</p>

<p class="answer">If you're actively editing a file, you should only
put in the files needed to <b>generate</b> the output.  Do not store
the intermediate or final output (pdf, log, aux, etc.).  This is not
just to save space (every little change, no matter how small, will
force a multi-megabyte file to be saved) but also because it can get
in the way of other people as they're compiling the document.</p>

<p class="answer">I also prefer using pdf and png files for graphics
(as appropriate); this is because the output of pdflatex is usually
better/easier than that of latex.  I also think
that <a href="http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/">ggplot2</a> is the best (free
or otherwise) tool for generating plots.</p>

<p class="answer">More specifically, I tend to do the following:
<ul>
  <li> Keep all style files (e.g. things that could be shared between submissions) in the "style" folder
   <li> Keep all bibliography files (e.g., bibtex source) in the "bib" folder
   <li> Have the main body in a file called "YYYY_project.tex" and the associated data (sections, graphics, etc.) in a folder called "YYYY_project"
   <li> This allows the Makefile to work well and reduces clutter
</ul>
</p>

<p class="question">I'm trying to use your code, but I'm having trouble.  How should I get help?</p>

<p class="answer">E-mail all of the people who worked on the paper associated
with the code with
<ol>
   <li> a minimal (simple as possible) example that can replicate your problem;
   <li> the inputs that replicate your problem (again, this should be as simple
   as possible; sending multi-megabyte files is usually not minimal);
   <li> exactly what you did (the exact command line used);
   <li> what you expected to see;
   <li> what you got instead (include error messages and any output); and
   <li> what versions of various resources you're using (NLTK, Java, gcc, boost,
   protocol buffers, etc.).
</ol></p>

<p class="answer">This information is necessary for us to help you with your
problem.  The simpler it is to replicate your problem, the faster you will get a
response.  More complicated setup take longer for us to try out and debug.  If
your example is simple enough, we can often see the problem ourselves without
running code.</p>

<p class="answer">Each e-mail should be self-contained.  All the information to
reproduce the bug should be in one place. This helps us quickly reproduce the
bug, and it also ensures that you've not tweaked anything that might prevent us
from isolating the issue.</p>

<p class="question">What's up with your name?  Why is it hyphenated?
Why is your OIT username ying?  What should I call you?</p>

<p class="answer">My parents' last names are Boyd and Graber.  When I
was born they hyphenated (why people whose nicknames were "Toni the
Body" and "Little Grabber" would do so is beyond me; my nickname is
obvious).  As a result, I am deeply, personally, against hyphenating
names.  Don't do it.  It's not a sustainable practice, and it leads to
all sorts of problems.  People think my last name is just "Boyd" or
"Graber", web forms don't think I have a valid name, and there's only
about a forty percent chance someone will get my name right after one
telling.</p>

<p class="answer">When I first got to Maryland, I was doing a postdoc in UMIACS,
and it didn't look like I'd use my OIT account for anything.  So I chose "ying",
my wife's family name.  Then I became faculty, and now it gets used for tons of
stuff.  However, it is easier to legally change my name to Ying in the state of
Maryland than to get a new OIT username (this unfortunately not at all a
joke&mdash;I have investigated both).</p>

<p class="answer">Most people call me Jordan, which is just fine by me.  I
also answer to JBG.</p>

<p class="question">How do I get to UMD on the train?</a>

<p class="answer">We're on the Northeast Corridor line of Amtrak.  To buy a
ticket, go to <a href="http://amtrak.com">Amtrak</a> and buy a ticket.  The
closest station geographically is New Carrollton.  There are two ways to get
from New Carrollton to UMD - you can either take
the <a href="http://www.wmata.com/bus/timetables/md/f4-6.pdf">F6 bus</a> or
the <a href="http://www.transportation.umd.edu/images/Shuttle/Schedules%20pdfs/current/126_NC.pdf">UMD
shuttle</a> (which sometimes checks for a UMD ID).  If you can't use either of
those connections (for instance, on a weekend, when neither runs) you can:
<ol>
 <li class="answer"> go to Union Station in DC and
taking the Metro to College Park (take the Red line from Union Station, transfer
to the Green line at Gallery Place-Chinatown),</li>
 <li class="answer"> take a taxi (about twenty bucks),</li>
 <li class="answer"> or get someone nice to pick you up.</li>
</ol></p>

<p class="answer">College Park is also on
the <a href="http://mta.maryland.gov/sites/default/files/Camden_Jan2013.pdf">MARC
Camden Line</a>.  This is very useful if you're in Baltimore or DC.  The line
doesn't run frequently, but if it matches up with your schedule, it's a great
way to get to or from College Park (it's faster and cheaper than the
Metro <b>and</b> it goes to Baltimore).</p>

<p class="answer">If you're starting from <b>New Jersey</b>
(e.g. Princeton or New Brunswick), then if you ask the Amtrak website,
it might seem that there are no trains.  There are, but they just
won't stop in Princeton or New Brunswick.  Instead, you first have to
take <a href="http://www.njtransit.com/sf/sf_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=TrainTo">NJ
Transit</a> from one of those locations to Trenton or Metropark
(Trenton is a much nicer station, and there's no backtracking if
you're going south).</p>

<p class="answer">Buy your Amtrak tickets early, as they do sell out.
Also note that prices are higher the longer you wait.  If you're going
to do this at all frequently, it's a good idea to buy a Student
Advantage card.</p>

<p class="answer">If you wait too long, the Amtrak tickets will get pricey.  If
that happens, you may want to consider taking a bus.  Many of the buses go to
Union station, but <a href="https://www.boltbus.com/default.aspx">Bolt Bus</a>
has an option that takes you directly to Greenbelt station (just north of
College Park on the green line).</p>

<p class="question">I'm a TA or grader for one of your courses; what do I need to know?</p>

<ol>
  <li> First, make sure that we have a meeting before the semester starts.
  <li> Attend at least a class or two to get a feel of what's going on.
  <li> As each assignment is posted, look it over to make sure I haven't done
  anything stupid (e.g., a confusing problem); it will make your life easier.
  <li> Once assignments arrive, create an ontology of all of the mistakes that
  people have made (do this before you start "grading"); this will allow you to
  fairly and consistently deduct points.
  <li> Using that ontology, create a template that you can use to provide
  feedback to students (e.g. by copy/paste or deleting).  This allows you to
  explain each mistake in detail without having to retype the same thing over
  and over again.  It also ensures that you give consistent feedback for each
  mistake people make.
  <li> Post a synopsis of the mistakes that people made and how to correct them.
  <li> Never give a grade without explaining why people got the grade they did.
</ol>

<p class="question">What's your Erd&#246;s number?</p>

<p class="answer">While at Princeton, I was also involved with the aphasia
project with Maria Klawe (as a result, I have
an <a href="http://www.oakland.edu/enp/">Erd&#246;s number</a>
of <a href="https://files.oakland.edu/users/grossman/enp/Erdos2.html">2</a>). My
Bacon number is as yet undefined (call me).  </p>
